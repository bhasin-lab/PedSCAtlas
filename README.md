## About

The **PedSCAtlas** was developed by the [Bhasin Systems Biomedicine Lab at Emory University](http://www.bhasinlab.org/) in collaboration with the [Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta](https://www.choa.org/medical-services/cancer-and-blood-disorders). The atlas allows for quick exploration, visualization of gene expression, and survival analysis of different pediatric solid and blood cancers without requiring extensive and time-consuming bioinformatics analysis and computational support. Currently the tool allows for the analysis of Acute Leukemias and Wilms Tumor pediatric cancer datasets. The web resource source code is written in R programming language and the interactive webserver has been implemented using the R Shiny and ShinyDashboard packages. The tool is currently hosted on a 64bit CentOS 6 backend server running the Shiny Server program designed to host R Shiny applications.
