# PedSCAtlas
Welcome to the Github Page for the **Ped**iatric **S**ingle **C**ell Cancer **Atlas** (PedSCAtlas)!

Please post any issues or questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/bhasin-lab/PedSCAtlas/issues) section.

You can visit the **PedSCAtlas** and start your analysis at this link: [https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/PediatricSC/](https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/PediatricSCAtlas/)

## About

The **PedSCAtlas** was developed by the [Bhasin Systems Biomedicine Lab at Emory University](http://www.bhasinlab.org/) in collaboration with the [Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta](https://www.choa.org/medical-services/cancer-and-blood-disorders). The atlas allows for quick exploration, visualization of gene expression, and marker testing for different pediatric acute leukemia types without requiring extensive and time-consuming bioinformatics analysis and computational support. The web resource source code is written in python programming language and the interactive webserver has been implemented using python dash packages. The PedSCAtlas currently houses leukemia/bone marrow datasets, but we have plans to expand to different blood/solid cancers in the future.

You can learn more about the datasets included in the **PedSCAtlas** and learn how to use the tool in the following sections.

## Guide

*Note*: All plots generated on the web portal are *plotly* figures, meaning they can be interacted with. See the *plotly* [docs](https://dash.plotly.com/minimal-app) for more information. 

### 1. Analysis Module

The Acute Leukemia dataset contains the scRNA-seq data from over 70 pediatric patients diagnosed with a subtype of acute leukemia. The fourth row, Single-Cell Gene Expression in Healthy Tissue shows a separate dataset of almost 400,000 bone marrow cells from adult healthy donors for comparison.

You can view the cells contained in the Acute Leukemia dataset on a UMAP, and group the cells in terms of different metadata, in the ***METADATA UMAP*** panel. Options to group cells by include: Cell Type, Diagnosis (or disease group), Sample Id, Time Point, Source (repository), and more.

The figure below shows the ***METADATA UMAP*** panel, with "Cell Type" chosen. The checkboxes on the left can be clicked and un-clicked to include different combinations of data in the plot. Every time a parameter is adjusted, the plot is re-generated.



### 2. Differential Expression Module

### 3. Marker Testing Module
