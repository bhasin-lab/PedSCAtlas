Please post any issues or questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/bhasin-lab/PedSCAtlas/issues) section, and see the [wiki](https://github.com/bhasin-lab/PedSCAtlas/wiki) page for a detailed user guide for the online atlas.

You can visit the **PedSCAtlas** and start your analysis at this link: [https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/PediatricSC/](https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/PediatricSCAtlas/)

## About

The **PedSCAtlas** was developed by the [Bhasin Systems Biomedicine Lab at Emory University](http://www.bhasinlab.org/) in collaboration with the [Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta](https://www.choa.org/medical-services/cancer-and-blood-disorders). The atlas allows for quick exploration, visualization of gene expression, and marker testing for different pediatric acute leukemia types without requiring extensive and time-consuming bioinformatics analysis and computational support. The web resource source code is written in python programming language and the interactive webserver has been implemented using python dash packages. The PedSCAtlas currently houses leukemia/bone marrow datasets, but we have plans to expand to different blood/solid cancers in the future.

You can learn more about the datasets included in the **PedSCAtlas** in the [home page](https://github.com/bhasin-lab/PedSCAtlas/wiki/Description) and learn how to use the tool in the [user guide](https://github.com/bhasin-lab/PedSCAtlas/wiki/User-Guide) of the wiki.
